abstract = {With the ever-growing performance gap between memory systems and disks, and rapidly improving CPU performance, virtual memory (VM) management becomes increasingly important for overall system performance. However, one of its critical components, the page replacement policy, is still dominated by CLOCK, a replacement policy developed almost 40 years ago. While pure LRU has an unaffordable cost in VM, CLOCK simulates the LRU replacement algorithm with a low cost acceptable in VM management. Over the last three decades, the inability of LRU as well as CLOCK to handle weak locality accesses has become increasingly serious, and an effective fix becomes increasingly desirable.Inspired by our I/O buffer cache replacement algorithm, LIRS [13], we propose an improved CLOCK replacement policy, called CLOCK-Pro. By additionally keeping track of a limited number of replaced pages, CLOCK-Pro works in a similar fashion as CLOCK with a VM-affordable cost. Furthermore, it brings all the much-needed performance advantages from LIRS into CLOCK. Measurements from an implementation of CLOCK-Pro in Linux Kernel 2.4.21 show that the execution times of some commonly used programs can be reduced by up to 47\%.},

abstract = {Abstract This paper is a critical review of exponential smoothing since the original work by Brown and Holt in the 1950s. Exponential smoothing is based on a pragmatic approach to forecasting which is shared in this review. The aim is to develop state-of-the-art guidelines for application of the exponential smoothing methodology. The first part of the paper discusses the class of relatively simple models which rely on the Holt-Winters procedure for seasonal adjustment of the data. Next, we review general exponential smoothing (GES), which uses Fourier functions of time to model seasonality. The research is reviewed according to the following questions. What are the useful properties of these models? What parameters should be used? How should the models be initialized? After the review of model-building, we turn to problems in the maintenance of forecasting systems based on exponential smoothing. Topics in the maintenance area include the use of quality control models to detect bias in the forecast errors, adaptive parameters to improve the response to structural changes in the time series, and two-stage forecasting, whereby we use a model of the errors or some other model of the data to improve our initial forecasts. Some of the major conclusions: the parameter ranges and starting values typically used in practice are arbitrary and may detract from accuracy. The empirical evidence favours Holt's model for trends over that of Brown. A linear trend should be damped at long horizons. The empirical evidence favours the Holt-Winters approach to seasonal data over GES. It is difficult to justify GES in standard form–the equivalent ARIMA model is simpler and more efficient. The cumulative sum of the errors appears to be the most practical forecast monitoring device. There is no evidence that adaptive parameters improve forecast accuracy. In fact, the reverse may be true.},

abstract = {Data compression plays a critical role in operating systems and large-scale computing workloads. Its primary objective is to reduce network bandwidth consumption and memory/storage capacity utilization. Given the need to manipulate hash tables, and execute matching operations on extensive data volumes, data compression software has transformed into a resource-intensive CPU task. To tackle this challenge, numerous prior studies have introduced hardware acceleration methods. For example, they have utilized Content-Addressable Memory (CAM) for string matches, incorporated redundant historical copies for each matching component, and so on. While these methods amplify the compression throughput, they often compromise an essential aspect of compression performance: the compression ratio (C.R.). Moreover, hardware accelerators face significant resource costs, especially in memory, when dealing with new large sliding window algorithms.We introduce BeeZip, the first hardware acceleration system designed explicitly for compression with a large sliding window. BeeZip tackles the hardware-level challenge of optimizing both compression ratio and throughput. BeeZip offers architectural support for compression algorithms with the following distinctive attributes: 1) A two-stage compression algorithm adapted for accelerator parallelism, decoupling hash parallelism and match execution dependencies; 2) An organized hash hardware accelerator named BeeHash engine enhanced with dynamic scheduling, which orchestrates hash processes with structured parallelism; 3) A hardware accelerator named HiveMatch engine for the match process, which employs a new scalable parallelism approach and a heterogeneous scale processing unit design to reduce memory resource overhead.Experimental results show that on the Silesia dataset, BeeZip achieves an optimal throughput of 10.42GB/s (C.R. 2.96) and the best C.R. of 3.14 (throughput of 5.95GB/s). Under similar compression ratios, compared to single-threaded/36-threaded software implementations, BeeZip offers accelerator speedups of 23.2\texttimes{}/2.45\texttimes{}, respectively. Against all accelerators we know, BeeZip consistently demonstrates a superior compression ratio, improving by at least 9\%.},

  abstract  = {Numerous systems have been designed which use virtualization to subdivide the ample resources of a modern computer. Some require specialized hardware, or cannot support commodity operating systems. Some target 100\% binary compatibility at the expense of performance. Others sacrifice security or functionality for speed. Few offer resource isolation or performance guarantees; most provide only best-effort provisioning, risking denial of service.This paper presents Xen, an x86 virtual machine monitor which allows multiple commodity operating systems to share conventional hardware in a safe and resource managed fashion, but without sacrificing either performance or functionality. This is achieved by providing an idealized virtual machine abstraction to which operating systems such as Linux, BSD and Windows XP, can be ported with minimal effort.Our design is targeted at hosting up to 100 virtual machine instances simultaneously on a modern server. The virtualization approach taken by Xen is extremely efficient: we allow operating systems such as Linux and Windows XP to be hosted simultaneously for a negligible performance overhead --- at most a few percent compared with the unvirtualized case. We considerably outperform competing commercial and freely available solutions in a range of microbenchmarks and system-wide tests.},
